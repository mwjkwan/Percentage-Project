## The “STEM” dream - why concentrate in STEM-related fields?

*What is the STEM dream?*

For some, it may be a hefty paycheck and job stability. For others, it could be the allure of fast-paced Silicon Valley startup life — the chance to be the next Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg. Perhaps it is its inherently multidisciplinary nature, allowing concentrators to combine engineering and computer science with the humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and more. Or maybe it is the promise of using technology for positive impact and better the world. 

<Person>Sarika Chawla ’23</Person>’s “STEM dream” is to someday create products to help other people with disabilities. “I want to be able to see the real impact that my work is having and see that it's helping people and helping communities," she said.

Robin Robinson ’22 imagines herself someday becoming a high school teacher to inspire kids to continue to pursue STEM, a field she feels is getting increasingly more important. As for Catherine Huang ’24, she believes technology on its own is “not too useful, but when you use it as a tool to combat social issues — that’s where I want to be at.” 

Meanwhile, environmental science and engineering concentrator Eric Jjemba ’21 hopes to combine his scientific education with his perspective as a Black man to understand how climate change will disproportionately impact certain communities.  

Ingrained in Harvard’s mission statement is the goal to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society” so that students can learn “how they can best serve the world.” How does Harvard promote — or inhibit — the STEM dreams of students from the first line of code to graduation? 

The findings of the Percentage Project show that one’s identity may play a critical role in one’s Computer Science and STEM experience. Over the past few months, we compiled data from a survey asking questions of those pursuing a concentration or secondary in STEM and CS adjacent fields as well as conducted over thirty interviews to paint a more complete picture of the experience of underrepresented groups in these fields.  

## The growing concentration

Computer Science is Harvard’s second largest concentration, trailing only economics. The Crimson reported that the number of CS concentrators had tripled in the past ten years. Applied math, too, was the fourth most popular concentration. One clear example of this growth is in Harvard’s famous introductory computer science class , CS50. In 2006, 132 students took the class. In 2019, 735 students opted to take the course. 

A 2017 Harvard Open Data Project report which analyzed concentration numbers over the years concluded, “Harvard students are shifting from social sciences to more quantitative fields like applied math, statistics, and computer science to be more competitive on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley, and in data-driven fields.” 

But with a bigger concentration comes more crowded office hours, larger lectures, and less individualized support, especially for those who might be coming from underrepresented backgrounds. 

A WiCS advocacy study from 2016 found that the level of male CS concentrators had increased every year between 2009 and 2016, from 73 to 261 concentrators, respectively. And although the number of female CS concentrators has risen from 18 to 89 in that same period, that growth has slowed in the past few years.

Lack of support for women and minorities in CS

[Anecdote about office hours]

Women studying CS were more likely to start learning to code in college than men, who start earlier, meaning women may need extra support. But only 27% of women reported feeling supported studying CS and related fields, while nearly 65% of men said they did. 39% of women had seriously considered leaving their concentration, as opposed to only 22% of men. 

Why is it that women who study CS and related fields and who are given the same access to office hours, platforms like Ed and Piazza feel unsupported in their studies compared to their male counterparts?

The disparities are just as grim for first-generation, low-income students.  

According to our findings, 84.21% of first-generation students feel intimidated studying Computer Science and related fields as opposed to only 46.28% of non first-generation students. First-generation students felt less confident studying STEM fields than others, and felt less respected by their peers, professors, and TFs.

For some, this aspect of their identity may be more impactful than anything else, including gender or race. 

“The main impact on me is probably being a first generation college student, and also the fact that my parents are immigrants, so that makes it like there are times where I feel like ‘Man, I don't know as much as other people, how do they know what they need to do,’” Helen Mehreteab ’23 expressed. “I've always felt that I don't know anything.” 

The Alex Patel fellowship program aims to provide one-on-one tutoring in computer science classes for students who need more support than they could get from office hours alone.
